  description: |
    Reflex-AI is designed to enhance human safety and social harmony by integrating advanced AI reflexes
    that respond to emotional and environmental cues. This system aims to protect individuals in crowded or potentially dangerous situations while maintaining ethical standards and user privacy.
  objectives:
    - Enhance human safety in public spaces
    - Promote social harmony through AI-assisted navigation
    - Provide real-time emotional and environmental analysis
  target_audience:
    - Researchers in AI ethics and safety
    - Developers of AI safety systems & AI engineers
    - Public safety organizations
